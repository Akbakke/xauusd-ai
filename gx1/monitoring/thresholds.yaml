# Production monitoring thresholds
#
# Prod-monitor reads these thresholds and writes alerts.json if any are triggered.

thresholds:
  # Trades/day
  trades_per_day:
    min: 0.1  # Minimum trades per day (alert if below)
    max: 10.0  # Maximum trades per day (alert if above)
  
  # EV/trade (basis points)
  ev_per_trade:
    min: 50.0  # Minimum EV/trade (alert if below)
    max: 500.0  # Maximum EV/trade (alert if above)
  
  # RULE6A allocation rate
  rule6a_rate:
    min: 0.0  # Minimum RULE6A rate (alert if below)
    max: 0.5  # Maximum RULE6A rate (alert if above, 50%)
  
  # Blocked RULE6A rate (guardrail effectiveness)
  blocked_rule6a_rate:
    min: 0.0  # Minimum blocked rate (alert if below)
    max: 0.8  # Maximum blocked rate (alert if above, 80% - guardrail too aggressive?)
  
  # Max loss streak
  max_loss_streak:
    min: 0  # Minimum loss streak (no alert)
    max: 5  # Maximum loss streak (alert if above 5 consecutive losses)
  
  # Range edge dist ATR - RULE5 vs RULE6A difference
  range_edge_dist_atr_diff:
    min: -2.0  # Minimum difference (alert if RULE6A has much higher range_edge_dist_atr)
    max: 2.0  # Maximum difference (alert if difference too large)

# Alert severity levels
