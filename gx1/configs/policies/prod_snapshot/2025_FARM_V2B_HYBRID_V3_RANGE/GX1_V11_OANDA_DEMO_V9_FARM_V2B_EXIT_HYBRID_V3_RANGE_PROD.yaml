# GX1 v1.1 → Hybrid exit controller V3_RANGE (PROD_BASELINE)

# Entry: FARM_V2B mp68_max5_cd0 (long-only)
# Exit: HYBRID_ROUTER_V3 - ML decision tree with range features (range_pos, distance_to_range, range_edge_dist_atr)
# Status: PROD_BASELINE (frozen 2025-12-14)
#
# V3_RANGE routing logic:
#   - Based on V3 decision tree trained on FULLYEAR 2025 data (1592 trades)
#   - Features: atr_pct, spread_pct, range_pos, distance_to_range, range_edge_dist_atr
#   - Tree uses range_edge_dist_atr in splits (range-aware routing)
#   - RULE5 default, RULE6A allocated based on ML predictions
#
# Tree structure (from exit_router_v3_tree_rules.txt):
#   - Primary splits on atr_pct
#   - Secondary splits on spread_pct
#   - Uses range_edge_dist_atr for edge cases (high spread > 98.47)
#   - RULE6A allocated in moderate ATR ranges (6.81-33.50) with acceptable spread
#
# Performance (FULLYEAR 2025):
#   - 162 trades
#   - EV/trade: 117.67 bps
#   - Win rate: 84.6%
#   - RULE5: 105 trades (64.8%), Mean PnL: 120.56 bps
#   - RULE6A: 57 trades (35.2%), Mean PnL: 112.33 bps
#   - RULE6A near edge (range_edge_dist_atr < 2.0): 50.9%

  documentation: |
    HYBRID_ROUTER_V3_RANGE provides ML-based routing using decision tree trained on range features:
    
    Key features:
      - atr_pct: ATR in basis points
      - spread_pct: Spread in basis points
      - range_pos: Position in range [0.0, 1.0]
      - distance_to_range: Distance to range [0.0, 1.0]
      - range_edge_dist_atr: ATR-normalized distance to nearest range edge [0.0, 10.0]
    
    Tree structure:
      - Primary splits on atr_pct (thresholds: 6.81, 10.65, 33.50, 61.34)
      - Secondary splits on spread_pct (thresholds: 0.50, 98.47)
      - Uses range_edge_dist_atr for high-spread edge cases (threshold: 0.08)
      - RULE6A allocated in moderate ATR ranges with acceptable spread
    
    Performance:
      - Trained on 1592 trades (FULLYEAR 2025)
      - Accuracy: 73.2%
      - FULLYEAR replay: 162 trades, 117.67 bps EV/trade, 84.6% win rate
      - RULE6A allocation: 35.2% of trades, 50.9% near range edges
