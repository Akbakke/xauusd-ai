# GX1 v1.2 → SNIPER ENTRY_V10.1 AGGR (OFFLINE_ONLY)
#
# Entry: ENTRY_V10.1 HYBRID (variant=v10_1, seq_len=90) with aggressive sizing
# Exit: HYBRID_ROUTER_V3 - ML decision tree with range features
# Mode: REPLAY (OFFLINE_ONLY - for testing V10.1 aggressive sizing)
#
# Configuration:
#   - Entry: ENTRY_V10.1 HYBRID (deeper Transformer, longer sequences)
#   - AGGR sizing: EntryV10_1SizeOverlay based on edge-buckets from 2025 FLAT label quality
#   - Exit: ExitCritic V1 + RULE5/RULE6A (same as P4.1)
#   - Same regime blocks and session filters as P4.1
#
# Expected: AGGR should show higher PnL but potentially higher tail risk
# Risk: Medium (aggressive sizing increases exposure)
#
# ⚠️  OFFLINE_ONLY: This config is for replay testing only. Do not use live.
# ⚠️  WARNING: Offline-only experiment. Do not use for live or demo without explicit promotion.

  description: >
    SNIPER with ENTRY_V10.1 HYBRID (variant=v10_1, seq_len=90) in AGGR mode.
    Same P4.1 regime blocks and execution, new V10.1 hybrid entry engine.
    Aggressive sizing based on edge-buckets from 2025 FLAT label quality analysis.
    V10.1 combines XGBoost snapshot expert with deeper Transformer sequence brain.
