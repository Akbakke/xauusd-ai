# GX1 v1.2 → SNIPER ENTRY_V10.1 FLAT UNGATED (OFFLINE_ONLY)
#
# Entry: ENTRY_V10.1 HYBRID (variant=v10_1, seq_len=90) with baseline sizing
# Exit: HYBRID_ROUTER_V3 - ML decision tree with range features
# Mode: REPLAY (OFFLINE_ONLY - for threshold discovery and label-quality analysis)
#
# Configuration:
#   - Entry: ENTRY_V10.1 HYBRID (deeper Transformer, longer sequences)
#   - FLAT sizing: Same baseline sizing as P4.1 (no aggressive size overlays)
#   - UNGATED: No p_long threshold filtering (min_prob_long=0.0, p_side_min=0.0)
#   - Exit: ExitCritic V1 + RULE5/RULE6A (same as P4.1)
#   - Same regime blocks and session filters as P4.1
#
# Purpose: Generate FULLYEAR 2025 replay with ALL V10.1 signals (no p_long gating)
#          to discover p_long distribution, label quality per quantile, and
#          optimal threshold candidates for FLAT entry (before considering AGGR sizing).
#
# ⚠️  OFFLINE_ONLY: This config is for threshold discovery only. Do not use live.

  description: >
    SNIPER with ENTRY_V10.1 HYBRID (variant=v10_1, seq_len=90) in FLAT UNGATED mode.
    Same P4.1 regime blocks and execution, new V10.1 hybrid entry engine.
    Baseline sizing (no aggressive size overlays).
    UNGATED: No p_long threshold filtering (for threshold discovery and label-quality analysis).
    V10.1 combines XGBoost snapshot expert with deeper Transformer sequence brain.
