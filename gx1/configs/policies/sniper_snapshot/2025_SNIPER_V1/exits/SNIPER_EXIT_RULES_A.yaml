# SNIPER Exit Rules A (RULE5)
#
# SNIPER-specific exit profile for EU/London/NY sessions.
# Based on FARM_EXIT_V2_RULES_A but with SNIPER-specific parameters.
#
# Key differences from FARM:
#   - May have different TP/SL/BE parameters optimized for EU/NY sessions
#   - May have different cooldown/max hold times
#   - Same engine code (RULE5) but different config values
#
# Status: SNIPER_V1 (can be tuned independently of FARM)
