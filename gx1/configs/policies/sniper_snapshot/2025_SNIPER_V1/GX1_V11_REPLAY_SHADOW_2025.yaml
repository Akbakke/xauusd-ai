# GX1 v1.1 → SNIPER Replay with Shadow Logging
#
# Entry: SNIPER (EU/OVERLAP/US + HIGH volatility allowed)
# Exit: HYBRID_ROUTER_V3 - ML decision tree with range features
# Mode: REPLAY (for building RL dataset with shadow + trades)
#
# This config is identical to SNIPER live, but:
#   - mode: "REPLAY" (instead of "LIVE")
#   - Shadow logging enabled via SNIPER_SHADOW_THRESHOLDS env var
#   - Output to runs/replay_shadow/...
#
# Purpose: Generate FULLYEAR 2025 dataset with both shadow hits and trades
#          for Entry Critic V1 training.
