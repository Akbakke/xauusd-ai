# GX1 v1.1 → Hybrid exit controller V3_RANGE (2024 baseline, uten guardrail)
#
# Entry: FARM_V2B mp68_max5_cd0 (long-only)
# Exit: HYBRID_ROUTER_V3 - ML decision tree with range features (range_pos, distance_to_range, range_edge_dist_atr)
# Window: Full 2024 (2024-01-01 → 2024-12-31) – supply dates via replay CLI
#
# V3_RANGE routing logic (uten guardrail):
#   - Based on V3 decision tree trained on FULLYEAR 2025 data (1592 trades)
#   - Features: atr_pct, spread_pct, range_pos, distance_to_range, range_edge_dist_atr
#   - Tree uses range_edge_dist_atr in splits (range-aware routing)
#   - RULE5 default, RULE6A allocated based on ML predictions
#   - NO GUARDRAIL (for comparison with guardrail version)
