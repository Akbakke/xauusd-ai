# ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL / NOT USED IN PRODUCTION ⚠️
# This config is archived for experimental purposes only.
# Production pipelines use long-only strategies (GX1_V11_OANDA_DEMO_V9_FARM_V2B_EXIT_A_PROD.yaml).
# GX1 v1.1 → SHORT_SNIPER experimental policy
# FARM_V2B entry stack with short-focused gating + EXIT_A RULE5 (long-only today)
#
# IMPORTANT: EXIT_FARM_V2_RULES currently supports LONG positions only.
# Running this policy today will yield zero trades; see docs/EXIT_A_SHORT_NOTES.md
# for the missing wiring required before shorts can be replayed end-to-end.
