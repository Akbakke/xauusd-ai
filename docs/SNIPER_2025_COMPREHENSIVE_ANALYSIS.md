## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. EV Consistency
- **Coefficient of Variation**: 15.2%
- **Assessment**: ⚠️ Moderate volatility - some quarter-to-quarter variation
- **Implication**: Policy performance is not perfectly stable, but remains profitable

### 2. Risk/Reward Profile
- **Payoff Ratio**: Improved from 0.53 (Q1) to 0.82 (Q4)
- **Loss Magnitude**: Improved from 21.25 bps (Q1) to 12.13 bps (Q4) average
- **Assessment**: ✅ Better risk management in later quarters

### 3. Q2 Anomaly
- Q2 showed exceptional performance in OVERLAP (16.63 bps) and US (16.38 bps)
- However, Q2 also had the largest average loss (-49.95 bps)
- This suggests Q2 had more volatile but profitable conditions

### 4. Q3-Q4 Stabilization
- Q3 and Q4 show more consistent performance
- Lower EV (7-7.5 bps) but better payoff ratios (0.81-0.82)
- Smaller average losses (10-12 bps vs 21-50 bps in Q1-Q2)

## 🔍 In-Sample vs Out-of-Sample Analysis

### Performance Comparison

**In-Sample (Q1)**:
- EV/trade: 9.14 bps
- Win rate: 93.1%
- Total trades: 4,283

**Out-of-Sample (Q2-Q4 avg)**:
- EV/trade: 8.13 bps
- Win rate: 90.5%
- Total trades: 1,624 (per quarter)

**Difference (OOS - IS)**:
- EV/trade: **-1.00 bps (-11.0%)**
- Win rate: **-2.6pp (-2.8%)**

### Assessment

⚠️ **MODERATE DEGRADATION**: OOS performance is slightly worse than IS, but:
- Still maintains positive EV (8.13 bps)
- Win rate remains high (90.5%)
- Performance is consistent across OOS quarters

**Recommendation**: 
- Monitor closely for further degradation
- Consider minor adjustments if Q4 trend continues
- Policy generalizes reasonably well, but not perfectly

## 🎯 Recommendations

### 1. Policy Assessment
- ✅ **Keep unified policy**: Performance remains positive across all quarters
- ⚠️ **Monitor Q4 trend**: If EV continues declining, consider adjustments

### 2. Risk Management
- ✅ **Payoff ratio improved**: Better risk/reward in Q3-Q4
- ✅ **Loss magnitude improved**: Smaller losses in later quarters
- ⚠️ **Q2 anomaly**: Investigate why Q2 had large losses despite high EV

### 3. Session Optimization
- **OVERLAP**: Strongest performer in Q2 (16.63 bps), consider focusing here
- **US**: Declined in Q4 (5.75 bps), monitor for further degradation
- **EU**: Stable performance (5-10 bps range)

### 4. Next Steps
1. **Continue monitoring**: Track Q1 2026 performance to see if Q4 decline continues
2. **Investigate Q2**: Understand why Q2 had exceptional performance but large losses
3. **Session analysis**: Deep dive into US session decline in Q4
4. **Regime analysis**: Understand why Q2 performed better across all volatility regimes

## ✅ Conclusion

SNIPER policy demonstrates **robust but not perfect** generalization from IS to OOS:

1. **Positive EV maintained**: All quarters show positive expected value

3. **Stable win rate**: High win rate (88-93%) maintained across all quarters
4. **Improving risk/reward**: Payoff ratio improved from 0.53 to 0.82
5. **Quarter-to-quarter variation**: Some volatility in performance, but within acceptable range

**Verdict**: Policy is **production-ready** but should be **monitored closely** for further degradation. The improving payoff ratio and smaller losses in Q3-Q4 suggest the policy is adapting well to market conditions.
